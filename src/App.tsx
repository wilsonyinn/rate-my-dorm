        "I lived at Manzanita Square for a year, and it was a great experience overall. The dorm is modern and well-maintained, with plenty of study spaces and common areas for socializing. The rooms are spacious and come with all the necessary amenities. The location is convenient, with easy access to public transportation and nearby shops and restaurants. My only complaint is that the noise from the street can be a bit loud at times, but it's manageable with earplugs. Overall, I would recommend Manzanita Square to any SFSU student looking for a comfortable and convenient place to live.",

        "Manzanita Square has its pros and cons. The building itself is very new and clean, and the rooms are quite comfortable. The study areas and common rooms are great for meeting other students and getting work done. However, the management can be a bit slow to respond to maintenance requests, which can be frustrating. Additionally, the rent is on the higher side, which might be a concern for some students. If you're looking for a modern living space and are okay with the price, it's a decent option.",

        "Manzanita Square offers a fantastic living experience for SFSU students. The rooms are spacious and well-furnished, and the common areas are perfect for socializing and studying. The building is secure, and I always felt safe living here. One of the best things about Manzanita Square is its proximity to campus and various public transport options. My only gripe is that the elevators can be a bit slow during peak hours, but it's a minor inconvenience. Overall, a great place to live!",

        "Living at Manzanita Square was a great decision. The dorm is clean, modern, and offers all the amenities you need as a student. The common areas are well-designed, providing a good balance between socializing and studying. The location is excellent, with easy access to the campus and local eateries. The staff is generally responsive and helpful, although there were a few times when maintenance took longer than expected. Despite that, I would still highly recommend Manzanita Square to fellow students.",
